##### - User Profile and User Model
- Once a user is signed-up or logged in he is redirected to User profile page where he can edit his data and also add an image.
- Django built-in User Model was used but some fields were added, this was to make use of built-in password hashers that django admin uses and also other built-in functions such as check_password, login and logout
